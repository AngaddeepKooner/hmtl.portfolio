<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a 3rd year computer engineering student at the Lassonde school of engineering. I am a technology driven and self-motivated learner with software and hardware skills. Motivated by challenging problem-solving use cases that require results. Work well in groups as well as autonomously. I am also a result driven and accomplished individual with strong organizational and time management skills. I have strong interests in math and data analytics and am fluent in 3 languages Hindi, Punjabi, and English.
â€‹I am currently working on my programming skills in C and Bash for Linux systems. A project I current worked on is a code that can read files that have a set format and give an output based on certain commands. For example, given a record sheet for textbooks for a different class I can use the id, book name, or another variable to search the file and match them with each other. Such as if I were to enter the book id it will output the class name and course code for which courses the book may be required. </p>
